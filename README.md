# swift-boilerplate

A boilerplate code template to kick start and accelerate Swift development in Xcode.

## Requirement
Items below are required before you can use this boilerplate.
1. Xcode 11 and above (This boilerplate is created using Xcode 11)
2. Cocoapods (Refer [here](https://cocoapods.org/) on how to install)
3. Supports iOS 11 and above (Does not support SwiftUI or iPadOS Multi-window, here's the [reason](https://fluffy.es/allow-app-created-in-xcode-11-to-run-on-ios-12-and-lower/) why)

## Installation
1. Clone the project
2. Open terminal and navigate to the directory where you clone this project
3. Enter as below to install pod dependencies (Assuming you already have cocoapods installed)

```bash
pod install
```
4. Launch Xcode and open the project via workspace
```
swift-boilerplate.xcworkspace
```
5. And you're good to go.

## Architecture

## Libraries
Common used third party libraries are included in this boilerplate
1. [DateTools](https://github.com/MatthewYork/DateTools) - Convenient way to format or modify your dates
2. [SVProgressHUD](https://github.com/SVProgressHUD/SVProgressHUD) - Clean and easy-to-use HUD meant to display the progress of an ongoing task

## Analytics
One of the commonly used to collect app's analytics and crash reports is Firebase. It is free and provides detailed information about crashes or memory leaks with insights on common issues with solutions on how to solve them.
Follow the instructions [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup?authuser=0) to add firebase into your iOS app.
